This software implements a number of standard and novel machine
learning algorithms developed to support my M.S. research.  The
primary goal of this research was to explore classification and
regression models based on metabolic profile data that incorporate
knowledge of the metabolic pathway network of the particular organism
from which the profiles are derived.  This general category of model
is called Pathway Informed Analysis (PIA).

Since all of the PIA algorithms are based on an undirected graphical
model structure derived from a set of metabolic pathways, tools for
retrieving and manipulating pathways are included as well.  There are
several public databases that provide metabolic pathways.  Only the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and BioCyc are
supported.

The methods used to create pathway-based classifiers and results on a
number of metabolic profile data sets are described in my M.S. thesis
available at

Note that this repository is currently incomplete.  My intention is to
add more software in the future as it is ready for release.  I hope
that others will find some of this stuff useful.
